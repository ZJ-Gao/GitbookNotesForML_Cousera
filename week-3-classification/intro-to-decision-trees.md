## Decision Tree Learning Algorithm

1. Choose an attribute from your dataset
2. Calculate the significance of attribute in splitting of data
3. Split data based on the value of the best attribute
4. Go to  step 1

> **Attribute**/Feature: An **attribute** is an aspect of an instance \(e.g. temperature, humidity\). **Attributes** are often called features in **Machine Learning**. A special **attribute** is the class label that defines the class this instance belongs to \(required for supervised **learning**\)
