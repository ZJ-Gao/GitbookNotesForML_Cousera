# Intro to Logistic Regression

* What problem can be solved by logistic regression?
* Which situation do we use logistic regression?

## Definition

Logistic regression is a classification algorithm for categorical variables.

## Applications

## When should we use logistic regression?

* Binary data
  * 0/1ï¼Œ yes/no, ture/false
* If we need probability results
* When we need a linear decision boundary

* If we need to understand the impact of a feature
  * the statistical significance of the logistic regression model coefficients of parameters

## Some conclusions

* Logistic regression is analogous to linear regression but takes a categorical/discrete target field instead of a numeric one.
* Logistic Regression measures the probability of a case belonging to a specific class.
* Logistic Regression can be used to understand the impact of a feature on a dependent variable.
