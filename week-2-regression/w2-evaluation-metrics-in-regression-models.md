# Evaluation Metrics in Regression Models

## Regression Accuracy

### Pros of evaluation metrices

Actual value/ predicted value

Evaluation metrics provides insights to areas that require improvement.

* Mean absolute error \(Easiest\)

* Mean squared error \(Pay more attention to the large errors\)

* Root mean squared error \(Interpretable\)

* **Relative absolute error \(Residual sum of square\)**

This is similar to MAE, but it is popular used in data science. It can be used to calculate R^2.

$$
R^2 = 1- RSE
$$

It represents how close the data points is to the fitted regression line. 

### Definition

The error of the model is the differences between the data points and the trend line generated by the algorithm.
